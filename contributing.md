# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this... please help us. ðŸ˜‡

Simply create a Pull Request and one of the maintainers will take a look. If you're a maintainer, read below for publishing steps.

Thanks! âœ¨

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/purecloudlabs/json-schema-designer/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Testing

Always run tests before merging a PR or publishing. Pretty please.
5/23/2019: There are currently no meaningful tests implemented - they are coming soon!

    $ npm test

## Publishing
In order to publish, you need to be added to the npm project, and also a maintainer here on github. Create a new version branch, build the project, commit (with the new dist files), tag it, and push to github. Once the PR has been approved and merged, you can publish via npm.

    $ git checkout -b version-X.X.X
    $ npm run-script build --prod
    $ update the version in package.json
    $ git commit -am "version X.X.X"
    $ git tag -a vX.X.X -m "version X.X.X"
    $ git push


Once the PR has been merged to master:

    $ git checkout master
    $ npm publish
